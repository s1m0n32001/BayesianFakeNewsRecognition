    "Our aim is to *classify* some phrases, using a predetermined set of categories $\\mathcal{C}$ (e.g. `{Fake, Not Fake}`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we must learn a *classification function* $\\gamma: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{C}$, where $\\mathcal{X}$ is the set of all possible input phrases. \n",

    "### The MNB classifier\n",
    "Given a class $c$ and a *document* (i.e. phrase) $d$, we can imagine that the document was composed by randomly extracting words from the total set of tokens $\\mathcal{T} = \\{t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_m\\}$. This way, the probability of composing the observed document would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(d|c) = \\prod_{1 \\leq k \\leq n_d} p(t_k|c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to infer $P(c|d)$. This can be done though Bayes's Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(c|d) \\propto p(c) \\prod_{1 \\leq k \\leq n_d} p(t_k|c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then easily find the *maximum a posteriori* class $c_{map}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{map} = \\mathrm{argmax}_{c} P(d|c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum a posteriori class will be our guess for the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The learning algorithm\n",
    "Our model depends on the following parameters:\n",
    "* **Prior**: $p(c)$. \n",
    "* **Token probability**: $p(t_k|c)$, the probability for token $t_k$ to appear in a document of class $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The prior can be estimated as $\\hat{p}(c) = \\frac{N_c}{N}$, i.e. the fraction of documents of class $c$ in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The token probability can instead be estimated as $\\hat{p}(t|c) = \\frac{T_{ct} + 1}{\\sum_{t'} (T_{ct' + 1})}$. The term $T_{ct}$ is the number of times token $t$ appears in a document of class $c$. Notice that, both at the numerator and denominator, we are adding $1$ to $T_{ct}$ and $T_{ct'}$. This is done in order to avoid having $p(t|c) = 0$ for tokens that never appear in documents of class $c$.\n",
